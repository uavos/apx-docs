# Comm ports

This feature provides physical serial ports mapping to Virtual Comm Ports (VCP). All VCP ports are accessible by other modules and addressed by `id` number.

## Usage examples

* [Protocols](protocols) module can use VCP to communicate to the physical device;
* [WASM script](script) can use VCP to receive and transmit data;
* VCP port can be forwarded to [GCS](/gcs) to provide transparent serial connection with some payload physical serial port;
* VCP port can be used to provide C2/telemetry communication with the GCS via user specific serial modem/datalink;
* RS485 driver can be used to provide SBUS signal for servos, generated by protocol;
