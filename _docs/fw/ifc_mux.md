# PHY Multiplexer

A node equipped with such module have a multiplexer device onboard.

The physical signals of other subsystems of the node can be re-mapped to any available multiplexed ports of the board.

Physical output pins on the PCB/Connector can be programmically remapped to any available driver, interface or internal signal.

See [gpio](controls_gpio) module for more details.
