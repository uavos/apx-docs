      \ following modes the port will act as \nnormal VCP data port, addressable via\
      \ `id`:\n  * `NODE`: VCP port received data is not broadcasted to \n  other\
      \ nodes in network, although it is available to all node resources;\n  * `LAN`:\
      \ VCP port received data is broadcasted to other nodes in network\n  and is\
      \ available to all nodes and their modules;\n* **Network interface modes**.\
      \ The special port modes can be used to configure the PHY as standard APX bus\n\
      network interface. Any received data packet is decoded by the node and forwarded\
      \ \nto other nodes by [`hub`](mod) module:\n  * `NMT`: forward and decode NMT\
      \ packets of the network, i.e.\n  acts exactly like `CAN` bus interface, but\
      \ filters everything except NMT packets;\n  * `BUS`: network gate interface,\
      \ forwards everything from the network;\n  * `TELEMETRY`: C2/telemetry serial\
      \ link, i.e. transmits telemetry data only;\n"
