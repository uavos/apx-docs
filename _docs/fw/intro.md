# Autopilot

Autopilot is capable to control almost any possible vehicle configuration (VTOLs, USVs, UGVs, etc.), including [non-standard aircraft concepts](https://youtu.be/eBxWUZUXCKQ). The flight control algorithm relies on *Total Energy Control System* (TECS) for improved reliability and sustainability to failures. Automatic landing with engine failures and auto-rotation for helicopters is fully supported.
