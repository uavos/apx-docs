# Hardware

Thanks to its [distributed architecture](/hw), the APX system can be used in vehicles from as small as quadcopter to big converted manned aircraft. The redundancy layers are provided as basic functionality. Any specific sensor or payload can be integrated by scripting custom protocols through [onboard scripting engine](/gcs/scriptcompiler).
